# Software testing for web

This Maven Project was made to practice automated web testing using Java, Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber/Gherkin.

I was applying for a Test Engineer role and the company required me to submit a project similar to this one, along with mobile testing as well. I ended up getting the job.
